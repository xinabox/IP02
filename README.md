## About the IP02
This ☒CHIP forms part of the interface programmer modules.

The FT232R is a USB to serial UART interface device which is equipped to power and program other modules via a USB A connector. The IP02 is required for programming the range of CPU Core ☒CHIPS over the USB-serial bridge provided by the FT232R.

The IP02 has two switches so that you can switch between DTE and DCE. The other switch is between A and B.

More information on the FT232R can be found in the [datasheet](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT232R.pdf).
